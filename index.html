                <h1>Navigation</h1>

                <p>
                    There is a two ways in Quoto to draw a navigation blocks &mdash;
                    a vertical navigation mode, and horizontal one, that regulated by <code>nav.navigation-horizontal</code>
                    or <code>nav.navigation-vertical</code> classes. Both of the modes have four fancy themes, a default,
                    a bordered, a light, and the dark. You can use those themes by append a theme class to elements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here is their classes: <code>.navigation-light</code>,
                    <code>.navigation-dark</code>, <code>.navigation-bordered</code>, and without any additional class, navigation element will use a default theme.
                </p>

                <h3>Horizontal navigation</h3>

                <div class="navigation-horizontal navigation-light">

                    You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it
                    killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb
                    out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived
                    the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd
                    say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold
                    a candle to man.
