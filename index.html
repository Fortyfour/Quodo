                <p>
                    There is a two ways in Quoto to draw a navigation blocks &mdash;
                    a vertical navigation model, and horizontal one.
                    Both of the models have three themes, a default, a dark, and the light.
                    By the way, you can add <em>no-border</em> class to the <em>nav</em> block to enable additional
                    ultra-light theme.
                </p>
